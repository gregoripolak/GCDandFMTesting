# MultiThreadingAndFileManagerTesting

This is my objective-c Multi-Tasking & FileManaging project.

I have implemented a simple few methods that

1) Run through an array of urls and downloads all from web on a dispatch group.

2) Saves each downloaded file to Application document folder.

3) Waits for all files to finish download

3) Returns FileSystem path for each URL downloaded.

5) Simple UI testing.
